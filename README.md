# Data Engineering App: Large-Scale stock market Data Processing and Visualization

This repository contains the source code for a powerful data engineering application that processes and visualizes large amounts of data. The application uses Apache Spark for processing the data, which is stored in CSV files. The app then leverages Flask, HTML, and CSS to build a user-friendly web interface for accessing and visualizing the processed data.

We will help traders make informed decisions with financial data. The traders are provided with access to real-time stock data and analysis tools to make informed trading decisions with high accuracy and speed.

Now a trader has access to 6875 stocks on which he/she can build algorithmic trading on.
If there is a traditional trader he/she can look at technical analysis posted using the charts in the web application


Launch the Flask application:
Copy code
python app.py

*The application will be accessible at http://127.0.0.1:5000.*
